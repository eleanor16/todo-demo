    <h2>Hi, there! My name's Hannah</h2>
      <p>
        and I'm a twenty-year-old college student who's trying to enjoy the fun
        in life. (By that I mean that I grow a <strong>lot</strong> of plants
        and like a strong cup of tea). I grew up in a small town surrounded by
        cornfields, but now I live in Chicago-a big change, I know. I'm studying
        chemical engineering which means that I take a LOT of chemistry classes,
        math classes, and ... other classes in the hopes that I can one day
        learn to mesh all this knowledge together and solve some real problems
        for a factory. But enough about my major-we'll get to that later. What
        else would you like to know about me? I could tell you that I have
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a cat named Socks</li>
          <li>a best friend named Lauren</li>
          <li>and a brother named Kyle</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="Lauren.JPG"  alt="Hannah and her best friend,
        Lauren standing together on a bridge" />
      <p>
        Or maybe you'd like to know that
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>my favorite season is fall</li>
          <li>my favorite color is green (like <em>this</em>)</li>
          <li>and my favorite book is Ender's game</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Or maybe you'd like to know why you're reading about me in the first
        place.

    <h2>Why this page exists</h2>
      <p>
        This semester I'm taking a class to learn the basics of web design. Now,
        I know what you might be thinking-what does web design have to do with
        chemical engineering?? Trust me, I've thought about it too, but this is
        2018, and I've been wanting to learn a computer language other than
        MATLAB for some time now, so here I am. Now you might be thinking,
        "Hannah, what do you hope to do by learning things like HTML, CSS, and
        Javascript?" Well, I'm so glad you asked! (If you didn't, now's your
        chance to). You see, in addition to my nerdy classes, I'm also in charge
        of publicity for two student organizations on my campus. Because of
        these positions, I have to manage and update our websites pretty often.
        However, the website for one of these groups (<a href="http://aiche0.wixsite.com/mysite">AIChE-IIT</a>) doesn't
        look very pretty or professional, and the other group doesn't even have
        a website right now. I'm hoping to be able to make a site for one of
        these clubs during this semester and then be able to make another one
        for the other organization sometime in the future (maybe during one of
        my holiday breaks). So there you have it. I'm trying to learn how to
        make webpages so that I can do my PR job better.

    <h2>What I'm doing with my life right now</h2>
      <p>
        Alright, new friend, it's time to talk about my major again. First of
        all, I'm a third-year student, so I'm pretty much halfway through with
        college. Now, let's talk about what I've done for the past 2 years here
        and what I hope to do during the last two. But first, let's step back a
        little more and discover why I even want to be a chemical engineer in
        the first place. (I actually get this question a lot-usually coupled
        with a grimace). When I was a senior in high school, I decided that I
        really wanted to work for L'Oreal because of a girls in STEM campaign
        they ran. There was only one problem-I didn't know what major to pursue
        in order to get hired for their R&D department. Lucky for me, I met the
        dean of engineering on one a college visits in Indiana, and he told me
        that I should study chemical engineering if I wanted to get in the
        company's good graces. I took that info and ran with it, and here I am
        today. For the past two years I've studied for my classes and gotten
        really involved with my campus's ChemE club, AIChE. During my last two
        years I want to take a step back from some of my PR duties for them so I
        can focus on research and internships.
      </p>
    <h2>Enjoying the Journey</h2>
      <p>
        After I graduate, I hope to either get a job relating to
        pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, or nuclear energy. However, I've also
        recently been thinking about moving back home to get my masters in
        chemical or agricultural engineering. (I mean, I did grow up surrounded
        by corn). I'm not really sure what these next two years and life beyond
        this campus holds for me, but I'm learning to be content with the
        unknown and enjoy the journey.
